how to build
============

on POSIX:

or
	dbg

then type
	make

to run the binary, type
	run

note that you can use these instructions everywhere, independent of your pwd.

how to convert gamedata
=======================

note that to actually run openage, you need to invoke the convert py script,
which will convert game data from an installation of the original game to the
openage format.

to do so, type

python3 convert $PATH_TO_YOUR_AOC_INSTALLATION .

e.g.:

python3 convert ~/.wine-age/drive_c/age/ .
