openage
=======


a free (as in freedom) implementation of

microsoft(r) age of empires II (tm) - the age of conquerors


brought to you by [SFT]Technologies.


this project is released under the GNU GPLv3 or later.
see the COPYING file for that.


although we use the original game data files,
our bundle does not ship any of the proprietary data used in aoc.
in order to play, you have to provide a aoe2:aoc installation,
or create free media files yourself.



dependencies
============

python3
python3 imaging library (PIL) -> pillow
opengl 2.1
glew
ftgl
dejavu font
freetype2
fontconfig




how to convert gamedata
=======================

The original aoc game data format is, lets say, a challenge to use.
Therefore it has to be converted in order to be usable with openage.

The python script for that is in the convert/ folder, it will convert all the
media files to formats being usable by openage.

This also means that you have to own the original media files, as we are way
too lazy to create free media files for now, that's something the community can do..


To convert ALL original media files to openage format, execute the following:

	python3 convert -o . $PATH_TO_YOUR_AOC_INSTALLATION

for example, if you installed aoc with wine:

	python3 convert -o . ~/.wine-age/drive_c/programs/ms-games/aoe2

You will then find the converted files in ./data/age/


try
	python3 convert --help
to see the usage, as you probably don't want to convert all the files (we don't use them yet..)

for converting only media files we do use at the moment, execute this:
	python3 convert -o . $aoe2-installpath $(make medialist)



how to compile && run
=====================

on POSIX:

	./configure <release|debug>
	make
	make AGE2DIR=~/.wine-age/drive_c/programs/ms-games/aoe2 media
	cd data && ../bin/openage

for other make targets, see:
	make help


alternate method: get developer function aliases by sourcing "build_helpers":
	source build_helpers

then type (depending on what build configuration you want):
	rls
or
	dbg

to compile the sources, type:
	make

to convert the media files, see above.

to run the binary, type:
	run

note that you can use these instructions everywhere, independent of your pwd (aliases, remember?)


on WINDOWS:
if you are keen on porting the game, go for it.


documentation
=============

after you configured the project, you can invoke
	make doc

to create doxygen html and LaTeX files.

after creation, view them in a browser by
	$(browser) bin/doc/html/index.html

or, if you want to create LaTeX documents:
    make -C bin/doc/latex/ pdf
    $(pdfviewer) bin/doc/latex/refman.pdf


i'd recommend looking at the source, as we try do write stuff as readable as possible.



cheers, happy hecking.
