Gameplay ideas
==============

This file contains ideas of how we could modify or enhance the original Age of Kings. There will always be a "vanilla mode", but you might find these ideas as awesome as we do.  

Weather
-------

* Change view distance (Line of sight / Fog of War)
* Fog, rain, winter, summer
* Unit slowdowns (depending on terrain)
* Can be predicted by tech
* Can be modified globally or locally (by voodoo priests)

Fire
----

Buildings made out of wood and other flammable material can be lit.
Fire departments in the city can extinguish those fires.

Day/night cycle
---------------

At night: View distance reduced, everything darker.
Villagers need sleep, otherwise they die at work.


3d terrain
----------

Villagers can dig down, can discover natural resources.
Dirt, stone, etc are new resources, can be placed elsewhere
(add any minecraft/terraria-like stuff here)


Infinite maps
-------------

Maps with infinite size! (Your architecture is the limit!)


(mmo)rpg games
--------------

play on one single map with 9001 players
you can imagine the lulz etc


research
--------

if unit upgrades are researched, only newly built ones recieve the bonus.
ones already built have to go back to the barrack and train again.
(reminder: this is only an idea, that _might_ be available optionally)
