blendomatic
===========


or: how to merge terrain tile edges.



alpha masks, that hide parts of terrain tiles, are stored in blendomatic.dat.


blendomatic file format
-----------------------

struct blendomatic_header {
	unsigned int nr_blending_modes;
	unsigned int nr_tiles;
};

for i in range(nr_blending_modes):

	struct blending_mode {
		unsigned int  tile_size;      //normally 2353
		unsigned char tile_flags[31];
		unsigned char alpha_bitmasks[4*tile_size]; //32 interleaved tiles, 1 bit alpha masks
	};

	for j in range(nr_of_tiles):
		char pixeldata[tile_size];


this is our drawing goal (of course a bit bigger).

    *

the pixeldata array contains values to be drawn as *
we have to add the spaces ourselve.

each * is a pixel, with one byte value, which just is an alpha value.

with the default tile_size, we end up drawing the rhombus with 49 rows.


this is then used to overlay on a regular terrain tile, so that parts are alphamasked.
