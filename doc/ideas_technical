braindead technical idea file
=============================

this file is nearly as idiotic as the gameplay idea file.
its focus is more on technical bugs (== features),
so it may also contain some crazy shit that will never end up being
in the engine.


inotify for game data files
---------------------------

watch the game data folder and update changed files in-game instantly.
e.g. when you change the a texture with GIMP and save it,
the ingame models are instantly updated.
this allows awesome live-testing for modders.
