Window coordinates [CWINDOW]: 2D (x,y)
	1 pixel per unit
	Origin is top left corner of window (0, 0)
	Bottom right corner: (width, height)

SDL Mouse coordinates [CSDL]: 2D (x,y)
	Identical to CWINDOW

HUD coordinates [CHUD]: 2D (x,y)
	Identical to CWINDOW

Game coordinates [CGAME]: 3D (NE,SE,Up)
	NE (North east) and SE (South east) diagonal to the window coordinates
	Position of the camera is given in Game coordinates
	Positions of all in-game objects (terrain tiles, units, projectiles, ...) are given in this format
	All physics calculations are done in game coordinates

Camera coordinates [CCAMERA]: 2D (x,y)
	Shifted version of CWINDOW
	Origin is center of window (CWINDOW position: width/2, height/2)

When rendering an object that is given in Game coordinates, the camera position is first subtracted.
The remaining value, which should be pretty close to (0,0,0) for all objects that are visible on the screen,
is then converted to float, transformed to camera coordinates and passed to the OpenGL renderer.
This way, floating point errors far out from the center of the map are avoided.
