This file contains ideas to "enhance" the original Age of Kings gameplay. Don't worry, vanilla mode will always be available.

Weather
-------

* Change view distance (Line of sight / Fog of War)
* Fog, rain, winter, summer
* Unit slowdowns (depending on terrain)
* Can be predicted by tech
* Can be modified globally or locally (by voodoo priests)

Fire
----

Buildings made out of wood and other flammable material can be lit.
Fire departments in the city can extinguish those fires (Stronghold anybody?).

Day/night cycle
---------------

At night: View distance reduced, everything darker.
Villagers need sleep, otherwise they die at work.


3D terrain
----------

Villagers can dig down, can discover natural resources.
Dirt, stone, etc are new resources, can be placed elsewhere
(add any minecraft/terraria-like stuff here)


Infinite maps
-------------

Maps with infinite size! (Your PC is the limit!)
Spherical/Toroidal/Cylindrical surfaces would be possible, too


MMO games
---------

Play on one single map with 9001 players

Massively slow down the game speed, and you get a "browser game"-like experience


Research
--------

Only newly-built units receive the bonus when units are upgraded
Already-built units need to be "overhauled" for a cost back at the barracks.
(reminder: just an idea, there will be vanilla mode)


Zombie Survival Mode
--------------------

The map has a bunch of zombie spawners; after an initial build-up phase,
they start producing waves zombie hordes, fast zombies, tanks, petard zombies;
the zombie AI tries to get to your villagers (magic pathfinding);
killed units turn into zombies as well. spawners can be destroyed,
but the closer or the more powerful you get, the more zombies will spawn.
to win, survive for a specified period of time, build a wonder,
or destroy the spawners (or something...)


Better movement
---------------

 - Move groups as group, or each unit with its own movement speed
 - Auto-resolution of blocking situations
 - Individual path searching cost for tiles
  - Allow user to mark parts of the map as more expensive
  - Auto-set a higher path cost for tiles in the firing range of an enemy castle
 - Allow setting any number of waypoints (basically an extension of the 'patrol' mechanic)


Lobby settings
--------------

 - Most of the above should be available as lobby settings
 - Boosts/handicaps such as resource multipliers for players
 - Forced no-rush (timelimit or score limit until attacks are possible)


For the lulz
------------

 - Big fat damage numbers!!!1
 - Friendly-fire toggle!!111
