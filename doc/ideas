braindead idea file
===================


this file contains ideas of how we could modify or enhance the original aok.
there will always be a "vanilla mode", but you might find these ideas as awesome as we do.



weather
-------

view distance reduced
fog, rain, winter, summer
unit slowdowns (on non-roads etc)
can be predicted by tech
can be modified globally or locally (by voodoo priests)

fire
----

buildings made out of wood and other burnable material can be lit
fire departments in the city can quickly extinguish those.

day night cycle
---------------

view distance reduced, everything darker
villagers need sleep, otherwise they die at work


3d terrain
----------

villagers can dig down, can discover natural ressources
dirt, stone, etc are new ressources, can be placed elsewhere
(add any minecraft/terraria-like stuff here)


infinite maps
-------------

maps with infinite size (haha your architecture is the limit)


(mmo)rpg games
--------------

play on one single map with 9001 players
you can imagine the lulz etc
