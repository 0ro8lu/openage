braindead technical idea file
=============================

this file is nearly as idiotic as the gameplay idea file.
its focus is more on technical bugs (== features),
so it may also contain some crazy shit that will never end up being
in the engine.


inotify for game assets
-----------------------

watch the game asset folder and update changed assets in-game instantly.
e.g. when you edit a texture file and save it, the in-game models are updated instantly.
this allows awesome live-testing for modders.

more challenging: when you update a unit stat in a text editor, it will update instantly in-game.
