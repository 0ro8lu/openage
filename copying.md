All files in this project, except those that state otherwise, or are listed below,
are licensed as **GPLv3**, or (at your option) any later version.
A copy of the license can be found in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

A note on per-file license headers: They're seriously ugly and incredibly bothersome to maintain.
We're doing this for fun and have better things to do than copy/pasting legal text blocks,
and staring at them each time we open one of our project files.
Seriously. We'd rather put all code in the public domain.

Nevertheless,

 - any 3rd-party file that is added to openage **must** contain origin/licensing information at its top or to this file (else we wouldn't be allowed to use it)
 - if you take any file from openage, add origin/licensing information at its top or to a file like this one (else you wouldn't be allowed to use it)

To get copyright/author information on specific files, use the version control system (e.g. `git blame`, or the GitHub web interface).
